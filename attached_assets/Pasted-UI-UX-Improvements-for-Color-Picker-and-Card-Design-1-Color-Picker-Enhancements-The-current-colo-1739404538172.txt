UI/UX Improvements for Color Picker and Card Design
1. Color Picker Enhancements:
The current color picker (black line) is not user-friendly. Here’s how to improve it:

a. Make It More Visible:

Replace the black line with a color palette icon (e.g., a dropper or palette icon).

Add a tooltip that says "Change Color" when hovered over.

b. Improve Usability:

Desktop:

Use a hover effect to make the icon interactive.

When clicked, show a pop-up color palette or color wheel.

Mobile:

Make the icon touch-friendly. Tapping it should open a large, easy-to-use color palette.

Allow users to swipe through predefined colors.

c. Reposition the Icon:

Move the color picker to the top-right corner of the card, next to the brand name.

d. Add Predefined Colors:

Provide a set of 6-8 predefined colors for quick selection.

Optionally, allow users to choose from a custom color wheel.

2. Card Design Improvements:
The current rectangular cards should be slightly more square for a modern look. Here’s how:

a. Adjust Card Dimensions:

Make the cards slightly more square (reduce the height-to-width ratio).

Ensure they remain responsive on all devices.

b. Improve Layout:

Center the brand name prominently.

Place the color picker in the top-right corner.

Add a subtle shadow or border to make the cards stand out.

c. Font and Hierarchy:

Use Montserrat for the brand name (bold, 20px-24px).

Keep the color picker icon small but noticeable (e.g., 24x24px).

3. Final Notes:
Goal: Make the color picker and cards intuitive, modern, and user-friendly.

Testing: Test the new design on both desktop and mobile.

Timeline: Let me know if you need clarification or have questions during implementation.
