Task: Optimize OpenAI API Usage for Efficient Name Generation

Objective

Optimize the OpenAI API usage for generating business names while ensuring cost efficiency, quality, and diversity. Improve the category selection UI/UX and implement a hybrid system that supports both manual selection and AI-driven recommendations.

1. Category System Implementation

1.1. Category Selection UI/UX Improvements

Replace dropdown selection with a structured category list (text-based, no icons/emojis).

Prioritize "E-Commerce & Online Business" as the first category since it is the most frequently selected.

Allow users to manually select a category from a grid-based layout.

Add a search box where users can type keywords to receive automatic category suggestions.

If a user selects a category, display its related subcategories automatically.

Users can override AI recommendations and manually choose a category and subcategory.

2. OpenAI API Optimization

2.1. Efficient API Usage

Reduce redundant API calls by caching previous requests.

If a user enters the same keywords as a recent request, return cached results instead of making a new API call.

Store the last 100 API responses and reuse them for identical queries.

Introduce an expiration mechanism for cached results (e.g., refresh every 24 hours).

2.2. Optimized Prompt Engineering

Ensure results are unique, diverse, and avoid repetition.

Modify the prompt structure based on the selected category.

Example General Prompt:

Generate 10 unique and brandable business names based on the following keywords: {keywords}.
The names should be fresh, non-repetitive, and aligned with the {category} industry.
Avoid generic or overused business name structures.

Category-Specific Prompts:

‚úÖ Finance & Crypto:

Generate 10 professional and reliable brand names based on {keywords}.
Ensure the names sound premium and align with the finance industry.

‚úÖ E-Commerce & Online Business:

Generate 10 catchy and memorable e-commerce business names based on {keywords}.
Make sure the names are modern and appealing.

‚úÖ Gaming & Entertainment:

Generate 10 engaging and dynamic brand names based on {keywords}.
The names should feel fun and appealing to a young audience.

2.3. API Parameters for Cost & Quality Balance

Temperature: 0.7 (Balanced randomness and creativity)

Top_p: 0.8 (Increase diversity in responses)

Max Tokens: 30 (Prevent overly long responses)

Frequency Penalty: 0.5 (Reduce repeated names)

Example API Request:

{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_p": 0.8,
  "max_tokens": 30,
  "frequency_penalty": 0.5,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a brand name generator."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Generate 10 unique and brandable names for a {category} business using these keywords: {keywords}. Avoid repetitive or generic names."
    }
  ]
}
